	What is the difference between forking and cloning

		Clone:

			clone is when you get a copy of the project from a remote repository (github) to a local repository (on your machine)

			from server --> to your local repository

		Fork:

			Forking is when you are getting a copy of someones repository onto your github account

			from someones github account --> your github account


		Both will link with the original repository so you can create pull requests later on
