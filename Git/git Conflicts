git Conflicts

	In git, a conflict happens when two people are modifying the same file, so git doesnt know how to combine the changes from both of you automatically

	When this happens we call it a git conflict

	How to manage git conflicts

		Generally you want to follow these steps,

		1.) git pull 

			this will check if there is a conflict, if there is, instead of pulling it will tell you that there is a conflict

		2.) git add . 

			This will stage the file you are currently working on on your machine

		3.) git commit -m "commit message"

			This will commit your files to your local repository

		4.) git pull

			NOW after you have committed your file changes, you can pull from the online repository, 

			Git will show you the conflicting files

			Example:

				My file:

					black
					red

				Online Repository file:

					black
					pink

				Git conflict display after Pull:

					black
					<<<<<<< HEAD
					red
					=======
					pink
					>>>>>>> 71f0821ba242a448ad8ee0d782dcaa7590c3606a

		5.) Fix conflicting files manually or via IDE in-build tools.

			Example:

				file after manual fixing:

					black
					red
					pink

		6.) commit again

			a.) git add

			b.) git commit -m "conflict corrected"

			c.) git push
