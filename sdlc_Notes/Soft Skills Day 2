Soft skills day 2

our titles after graduating could be:

	qa testers, qua analyst, qa test engeneering , sdet(highest level)

Software testing:
	done during the development process.

	the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding bugs.

Verification
	"are we building the product right?"
	
	is a process to make sure the product satisfies the conditions imposed at the start of the development phase

	make sure the product behaves the way we want it to


Validation
	"are we building the right product?"

	is the process to make sure the product satisfies the requirements at the END OF THE DEVELOPMENT PHASE.

	to make sure the product is built as per customer requirements

Software testing typses:

	Static Testing:
	verification process
	//As testers we do static testing by beer reviewing test case document
		//1. analyze the requirement
		//2. create test case documetn
		//3. peer review test case doc.
		//4. start to perform manual testing
				(can not automate testing until you understand how the program is supposed to perform)

		//EXAMPLE TEST CASE
			1. open url www.amazon.com
			2. enter valid user name and password
			3. click on sign in

		Review

		Walk through

		Inspection

	Dynamic testing:
	validation process

		Non Functional:
			//mostly performace testing

			Load testing:

			Stress testing:

			volume testing:
			e

		Functional:
			//mostly functionality testing

			adhock testing vs exploratory testing:
				both are random or informal testing
				ad-hoc testing : done by testers who want to know the application well
				purpose : finding bugs+

				exploritory testing : done by terster who does nt know anything about the application
				purpose : to learn and explore the application.
