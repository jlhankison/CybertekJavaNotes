SDLC Tester


Steps for testing:

	1. Requirement Analysis

		Testing team should read the requirement CAREFULLY

		Testing team should study requirement from a testing point of view (whatever the fuck that means, lady).

		Team lead assign requirement/user story, or you may choose

	2. Rest Plan Creation

	3. Test Case Creation


Test Scenario vs. Test case vs Test Script

	Scenario:

		"what to test"
		
		Test Scenarios are the overhead ideas behind test cases. "I want the user to be able to log in with correct credentials" is a test Scenario that has many test cases associated with it.

	Case:

		"how to test"

		Much more specific, test cases walk through each step of the QA, writing down the steps taken clearly so that the result can be duplicated exactly

		input valid credentials --> user: abc@gmail.com pass: 123456 into a login prompt and press "Login". Should result in opening the corresponding user profile page

		Like this ^^ but even more specific! 

		this testing is done manually! Using Jira

	Script:

		"repeat ad infinitum"

		Test Scripts are scripts written by the automated testers to automatically run regression testing.

		Scripts are usually just test cases put to code to automate the process. THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC IN YOUR DOCUMENTATION!!
