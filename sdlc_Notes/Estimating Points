Estimating Points

	How to Estimate Backlog User Story Points:

		1.) PO explains the user story 
		2.) Questions &Answer
		3.) Each person shows a card 
		4.) Discuss highest and lowest points 
		5.) Vote again in 2nd round if necessary

		1 point == 1 day 
		
		points include both developing and testing days 
		
		say the developer gives 5 points, this would mean 5 days; 3 days for developing 2 days for testing.
