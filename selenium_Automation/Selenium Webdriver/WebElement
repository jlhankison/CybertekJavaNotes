WebElement:

	Radio buttons

		Radio buttons are a html type="radio" element

		Radio buttons associate with each other based on their NAME, so multiple radio buttons with the same name will only allow ONE button to be pushed at a time

		with radio buttons you can not call the .getText(); method, It will not output anything, Use getAttribute("attribute here"); method to display values

	Testing WebElements:

		The testing priority for webElements;

			1.) element must be present

			2.) element must be visible

			3.) element must be enabled

	Frame:

		used to insert one html document on another one. there are two types of frames: Frame and Iframe

		<frame>

			used to divide page in sectors

		<iframe> 

			used to insert one page inside another one, anywhere.

		to be able to interact with the content inside a frame, you need to swich to it:

			Frame Methods:

				driver.switchTo().frame("nameOrID");  

					switch by id or name of the frame

					usually all frames have an id or name

				driver.switchTo().frame(index); 

					switch by index starting at 0

				driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement);

					if frame doesn't have a name or id. and the index doesnt give accurate frame position, use WebElement.


				driver.switchTo().defaultContent();

					to exit from the frame. if you don't exit, selenium will not see the content outside of this frame.

	Select:

		Select is reserved for drop-down menus 

		Declaring Select:

			You must declare a Select object with your driver to navigate the drop-down menu

			1.) First you may Declare a WebElement object by using a locater to find the drop-down menu (you can do this any way you would locate any other WebElement)

				Example:

					WebElement example = driver.findElement(By.id("drop-down"));

			2.) Next you need to declare your Select 


		If the drop-down menu is not a Select Type:

			In the case of non Select drop-down menus all you need to do is use the driver to click on the drop-down button and then click on the specific option you wish to select (do both using separate locaters for each)
