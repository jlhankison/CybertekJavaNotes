Xpath Locaters

	What is Xpath

		Xpath is defined as xml path. it is a syntax or language for finding any element on the web page using xml path expression. Xpath is used to find the location of any element on a webpage using HTML Dom structure

		cliff notes:

			1.) Xpath stands for xml path language

			2.) Xpath uses "path like" syntax to identify and navigate nodes in an xml document

			3.) Xpath contains over 200 built in functions

			4.) XPath is a major element in the XSLT standard

			5.) XPath is a W3C recommendation 

		RULES:

				Index:

					Xpath indexes are not like Java indexes, 1 is the first index, not 0.

		Types of Xpath:

			Absolute Xpath (AKA full Xpath)

				never used in automation because it's not reliable 

				Absolute Xpath always starts with the root element, in the case of an Html document it would be /html

				Absolute Xpath ALWAYS starts with a single forward slash

				to get the Absolute Xpath you must give the address of the element from the top all the way to the bottom 

				square brackets [] are used to indicate which tag you are referring to when there are more than one example of a tag. THIS IS NOT IN INDEX FORMAT 1 IS THE FIRST, 2 IS THE SECOND AND SO ON...

				Example:

					/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div/button[2]

			Relative Xpath

				ForRelative XPath,the path starts from the middle of the HTML DOM structure. It begins with the double forward slash (//), which means it can search for elements anywhere within the webpage.

				Anatomy:

					Example Relative Xpath:

						//tagName[@attribute=â€˜value']

					//
						beginning of element

					tagName
						tag name of element

					@
						indicates that you will be selecting an attribute

					Attribute
						Attribute name of the element

					Value
						Value of attribute 

				Finding element:

					By Attribute:

						Template example:

							//tagNameHere[@attributeHere='attributeValueHere']

						Real examples:

							//button[@onClick='button1()']

					By Text:

						Template Example:

							//tagNameHere[text()='some text here']

						Real example:

							//button[text()='Click for JS Prompt']

					Without Tag:

						basically, just use * where the tag would normally be

						Examples:


							//*[@attributeHere='attributeValueHere'] 

							//*[text()='some text here']

					starts with:

						used to find an element based on the START of an attribute or text

						example:

							//tag[starts-with(@attribute,'button_')]

							//tag[starts-with(text,'text goes he')]

					Contains:

						used to find element that partially contains the attribute value or text value

						Example:

							//tag[contains(@attribute,'value')]

							//tag[contains(text, 'goes')]

				Example:

					//input[@id='btn']
