Data Tables

	What are data tables?

		Data tables are information organized into columns and rows

	HTML Tags:

		<table> ... </table>

			This is how you start a Table in Html

		<thead> ...</thead>

			this is the first row of the table which holds the labels of each of the columns

			<th> ... </th>

				Same as <td> except that it gives the table header instead of data

		<tbody> ... </tbody>

			this is where the body of the table is, ie all the data the table represents exists

		<tr> ... </tr>

			"Table Row" this indicates that this is a row of data within the <tbody>

		<td> ... </td>

			"Table Data" this is the final level of the table, the individual cell that holds the data

		Example:

			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th> A1 Header </th>
						<th> B1 Header </th>
						<th> C1 Header </th>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td> A2 Data </td>
						<td> B2 Data </td>
						<td> C2 Data </td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td> A3 Data </td>
						<td> B3 Data </td>
						<td> C3 Data </td>
					</tr>
