Parallel testing

	Parallel testing is when you have multiple tests running at the same time (in parallel) 

	to set up your code to run test cases in parallel your driver utility must be capable of handling multiple threads (drivers) at the same time. If the driver is just a singleton it will not be able to run multiple browsers at the same time. 

	In order to fix this problem you can use the ThreadLocal class. ThreadLocal<WebDriver> allows us to create a collection of WebDrivers that are capable of running in parallel
