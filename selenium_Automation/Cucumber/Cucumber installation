}
#####These 2 parameters are mandatory!#######
glue - path to the package with step definition methods.

REMEMBER!!! DON’T ADD SUBSTEPS PLUGIN! IF YOU HAVE IT - DELETE IT!
You need 2 plugins only:
Cucumber for Java -- by JetBrains
Gherkin 		  -- by JetBrains
After installation, restart an Intellij.
then ,all your feature files will have a green icon
if feature file icon is blue - delete substeps plugin
If feature file icon is gray, even after installing plugins:
Check Settings->Editor->File Types. Verify that Cucumber Scenario is set to a Registered Pattern of *.feature.
command + option + esc - force quit some program
control + alt + delete - right on program --> end task
How do we create feature files??
Right click on the features directory --> new --> file --> *.feature
#### User Gherkin by JetBrains
There is a chance that you intellij version is too old, and plugin cannot be installed. So you need to update intellij first.
