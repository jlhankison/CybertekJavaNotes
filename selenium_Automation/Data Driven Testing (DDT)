Data Driven Testing (DDT)

	DDT is when your test data is separate from your code. Basically, you don't store test data in variables.


	Where can DDT data be stored?

		1.) Excel
		2.) csv files
		3.) databases
		4.) feature files when using Cucumber

	How to read external data:

		Excel:

			Use the Java library: Apache POI

		csv file:

			csv is a plain text file where values are separated by a comma. to read it you can use Scanner.

		data base:

			JDBC API

	Why use DDT? 

		It allows us to run the same script with different test data


	DDT using TestNG

		TestNG natively supports DDT through Data Provider

			Data Provider:

				allows us to run same test multiple times with different test sets

					Example:

						You have test cases where you need to create cars

	testng xml Runners:

		testing.xml --> xml that is used to create test suits.

		xml runner file names:

			default name is testing.xml

			however, name can be anything, like: smoke.xml,regression.xml, fleet.xml

		You can create as many xml runners as you need

		xml runner file requirements:

			should start with one line that specifies document type:

				Example:

					<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd" >

			Tags:

				xml runner files use tags similar to HTML files do, with opening and closing brackets (<>)

				<suite
