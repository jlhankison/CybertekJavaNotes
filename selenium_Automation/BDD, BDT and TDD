BDD, BDT and TDD

	BDD:

		Behavior Driven Development

		BDD is development from the User Interface point of view.

	BDT:

		Behavior Driven Testing

	TDD:

		Testing Driven Development

	Similarities:

		They are both about development and automated testing.

		In both cases, tests will be written before development process/code implementation.

	Differences:

		TDD:

			We deal with the raw code.

		BDD/BDT:

			It's about testing the functionality from end-user perspective. So we are not dealing with raw code.
