Java is a pass by value language <-- remember this phrase

	when you pass a variable to another variable (x = y) the value is being passed

How do you make a "constant" in Java?

	there is no designated "constant" in Java so you make a -->> public static final variableType variableName = permanentValue;

What is the difference between Overloading and Overriding a method?

	Overloading a method gives you the option to call a method while inputting different arguments into the method. 
	Overriding replaces the exact parameters of the method in a sub class. toString() is a great example.

since Java 8 was developed, Interface can have more than just abstract methods ( default )
