OBJECT CASTING

Within Polymorphism, you can cast an object UP to a higher super class (maxing out at "Object" class) or cast DOWN to a child class (bottoming out at the objects specific class)

	UP-CASTING:

		Up-casting is the process of casting a more specific (or smaller, or sub class) object within a more abstract (or larger, or super class) object.

			Example:

			Object exampleName = new Dog(exampleArg);

			^^ Object is the grand daddy of all classes, which all other classes inherit.  By creating a new Dog object within the rules of Object class allows you to group very dissimilar classes together

			RULES:

				1.)  When up-casting your object is IMPLICITLY created (similar to up-casting in primitives)

					Example:

					Circle c1 = new Circle(); // <-- Circle object created

					Shape s = c1; // <-- Circle object is implicitly
									// casted to Shape



	DOWN-CASTING:

		Down-casting is the process of casting an object to a smaller (or sub class) object.

		RULES:

			1.) When Down-casting you MUST Explicitly cast into the smaller class (Just like when down-casting primitives).

				Example:

				Object o = new Dog(); // <-- Object is created here

				Dog d1 = (Dog) o;  //<-- This explicitly casts Object o to
									// the smaller type Dog.

			2.) When down-casting the object that we are down-casting to the subtype MUST have been originally instantiated via original subtype

			Example:

			Object o = new Dog();//<-- Creation of the object

			Dog d1 = (Dog) o; //<-- Down-casting Object "o" to Dog type 

			Cat c1 = (Cat) o; //<-- this will fail to cast because Object o
								// was originally instantiated with Dog
								// class

		EXCEPTION ERRORS:

			1.) Down-casting will throw an exception error when you try to cast a SUPER TYPE OBJECT (Example: Object o = new Object();) 
			into a sub type (Example: Dog d1 = (Dog) o)
