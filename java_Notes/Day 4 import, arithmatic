Day 4


Arithmetic Operators:

	raw udefined numbers will be interpreted by java as "int" and will also produce int. (1, 5, 200, 18)

	Data Types:
		arithmetic operator between to int -->> another int

		Arithmetic operator between two numerical data types the final result wil be the larger data type

	+
		basic addition

	-
		basic subtraction

	*
		Basic multiplication
	/
		basic division
			will produce a the nearest whole number if defined as int
				5/3 = 1 (not 1.66666...)

	%
		Remainder/ modulus

Importing Java classes
	
	Java classes are organized into packages and need to be imported to your class to be used.

		Example:
			Scanner
				import java.util.Scanner;
			Time


Scanners:
	How a user interacts with a program, user types or interacts with program in some way and that is turned into input for the code.

		
			import java.util.Scanner;
				
				This imports the "Scanner Class" to your current code in java

			Scanner userInputHere = new Scanner(System.in);
				
				This makes the program ask a question of the user which will be stored as "userInputHere"

			String variableHere = userInputHere.next();
				
				This converts the input in "userInputHere" to a String, labeled "variableHere".
					You must add .next(); to capture single words scanned by the Scanner Class
