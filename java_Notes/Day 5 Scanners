Scanner
	Scanner is a class that comes from the JDK library
	we can use it to capture keyboard presses 

	Importing Scanner

		in order to use Scanner we have to first import it


	Creat scanner object
	
		Scanner scanExamp = new Scanner(System.in);

			after you have started a new Scanner (scanExamp) you can reference back to that scanner by using the Scanner Name + .next();
				this will prompt another input from the user.

				example:
					String exampleString = 	userInput.next();
					int exampleInt =  		userInput.nextInt();

	there are a few ways to get user input and store the result

		Getting singe word as String 				--> scan.next();
		Getting singe NUMBER as int 				--> Scan.nextInt();
		Getting single fractional number as double 	--> scan.nextDouble();
		Getting single true or false as boolean 	--> scan.nextBoolean();
