SINGLETONS

	Sometimes you want to create ONLY ONE OBJECT within that class

	This is a design pattern called Singleton
	it allows you to restrict the class to only creating ONE OBJECT

	A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance. It contains static variables that can accommodate unique and private instances of itself. It is used in scenarios when a user wants to restrict instantiation of a class to only one object.

		Example:

			public class Singleton {


		    private static Singleton instance;

		    private Singleton() {
		        System.out.println("NO ARG CONSTRUCTOR BEING CALLED!!");
		    }

		    public static Singleton getInstance() {

		        if (instance == null) {
		            instance = new Singleton();
		        } else {
		            System.out.println("We already have this object");
		        }

		        return instance;

		    }
		}
