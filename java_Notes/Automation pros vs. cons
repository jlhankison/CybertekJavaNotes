Automation pros vs. cons


AUTOMATION PROS:

 	*Process efficiency:

 		Automation is likely the most efficient way to perform a redundant or repetative task. Automated tasks do not waste time or energy when performing tasks, they just repeat endlessly until turned
 		off, breakdown, or lack of resources halt their progress.

	*Error reduction:

		Automated processes tend to be very good at repeating the tasks they are given with high levels of acuracy, far above that of a human performing the same task.

	*Speed:

		Automated tasks are usually performed at a much higher rate of speed than a human as the machines or computers used in Automation are purpose built to perform those tasks.

	Removes repetative mind numbing tasks:

		Humans are not well suited to perform the same task over and over endlessly, having Automated processes perform the more mundane repetative tasks, we are free to spend
		our mental resources towards more advanced productions like design or problem solving.


AUTOMATION CONS:
	
	*Design:

		Automation often requires a great deal of thought and design to impliment usually requireing highly skilled technical professionals. 
		This can lend to the initial implimentation of automation being expensive and slow. For individual tasks, manual performance is often the quicker, cheaper way to go.

	*Cookie cutter results:

		While not necessarily a "Con", Automation, by definition, will always produce the same exact result every time it itterates. This is perfect for some applications but
		is not always desired. 

			For example; a person purchasing a custom table may prefer that the product have some of the marks of inconsistancy or craftsman inspiration that results
				from a manual production of the table over an automated product.

	*Maintenance:

		While automated processes are more efficient per product produced, Automation comes with its own set of expenses and Maintenance. Often it requires highly paid professionals
		to keep an automated system or process at full (or even partial) efficiency.

	Incapable of adaption:

		Basically by definition Automation is Incapable of adapting to changes, increasing process efficiency or truely making changes of any sort.  An automated process is basically a 
		train on tracks, very good at doing the 2 dimensional process it was designed to do, but completely Incapable of lateral concepts or inovation. 

		Inovation is still very much in the domain of human intelect, our minds allow us to think beyond our programming and create new ideas or concepts seemingly out of thin air
		(though this is debated).

	Responsible for losses of jobs:

		This is more of a macro economics con of automation, in that for every task that humans once did that machines now can do there are Fewer Jobs available to human workers.
			While there is an uptick in jobs needed to Maintain automated processes, the whole point of automation in the first place is to Reduce the number of places Human Error
			can enter into production processes. So while there may be some jobs created by automation over all there will be fewer jobs that humans can perform in that particular 
			industry.

	Automation pro/con pairings:

		Process efficiency <--> Maintenance

			Automated production is highly efficient with little to no downtime when running at full Functionality however automated processes often require a host of highly trained (and paid) 
			professionals to keep automated systems working at peak (or even partial) performance.

		Error reduction    <--> Cookie cutter results

			While automation does tend to produce nearly identical results no matter how many times you repeat the process, this is not always a desired result, depending on the product or Consumer.
				For example; a person purchasing a custom table may prefer that the product have some of the marks of inconsistancy or craftsman inspiration that results
				from a manual production of the table over an automated product.
			For certain tasks, Automation is the perfect answer to production. but certainly not always.

		Speed increase 	   <--> Design costs

			Tasks performed by an automated system, in general are much much faster at producing a product or result than a human performing the same task. The counterpoint to this is that the design costs 
			(and resources) associated with creating a new automated task are often high, usually significantly more so than the performance of just one (or even several) of the tasks manually.  

			As a rule, high repetition is usually required to make an automated process worth while.

		Removes repetition <--> Incapable of adaption

			Humans are not well suited to repetition, we get lazy, complacent, or distracted while performing repetative tasks which results in poor efficiency and a high level of human error. Automation 
			is idealy suited to reduce these human errors in nearly every fascet of repetative production. 

			However, as humans are not good at repetative tasks we excel at adaption and inovation, of which automation is woefuly Incapable. Automation is essentially a train running on a set track,
			while it is very good at its 2 dimensional, narrow process, it lacks any ability to adapt to unforseen changes or inovating new solutions to a problem.

				The domain of creation and imagination still sits squarely in human hands.

		Final con:

		Responsible for job losses

			This is more of a macro economics con of automation, in that for every task that humans once did that machines now can do there are Fewer Jobs available to human workers.
			While there is an uptick in jobs needed to Maintain automated processes, the whole point of automation in the first place is to Reduce the number of places Human Error
			can enter into production processes. So while there may be some jobs created by automation over all there will be fewer jobs that humans can perform in that particular 
			industry.
