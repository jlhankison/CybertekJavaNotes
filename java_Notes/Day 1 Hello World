//DAY 1 


Computer (CPU ) understand 0 and 1 

As a programmer ,  we don’t write 0 , 1


WE WRITE : SOURCE CODE    just like System.out.println(“hello world”);

Eventually the source code has to be turned into machine code (0 1s).


SOURCE CODE  ——               Compiler   / Interpreter      ————  MACHINE CODE (0,1)

 The Java code you write is source code ,  

    | 
Java Compiler.  —>> this come with the installation of your Java 
    | 

It will eventually will be turned into machine code (0,1)


Java is considered a hybrid language

Java takes middleground when compiling the source code and turning it into machine code
						Compiler(Converter)
Java source code----	 byte code						Machine code (0,1s)




Programing Text editor:
	Sublime, Text++

Like Microsoft word for sourse code, helps with sintax and organization


IDE - Integrated Development Environment
	IntelliJ, Eclipse

Allows you to actually compile and run your programs

psuedocode
	use human language to outline a structure to your code
		1. pick up phone book
		2. open to middle of phone book
		3. look at names
		4. if Smith is among names, call Smith
			5. Else open first quarter of phone book
			6. Look for Smith among names
			7. If Smith is among names, call smith


Data types:
	Numeric (int): 123, 3.1415
	Character (string): "These are words"
	Logical (boolean): true/false

Data Containers
	Variables: temporarily hold changable data, can only hold data of its own type (int = numbers, boolean = true/false, string = characters )

	Declaring a Variable
		Java
			int score; (declaring the variable is an integer)


Conditional Branching ('if then' statements)
	IF (condition is true) THEN
		Do this;
	ELSE
		Do something else;


	Multiple Branches:
		If True
			if True
				execute A
			else
				Execute B
			end
		Else 
			If
				Excecute C
			Else
				Excecute D
			End
		End

Repetition/Looping
	
	"For" Loops


Symbol check
	{Curly Braces} {}
	[Square Brackets] []
	(Parentheses) ()



Java Development Kit (JDK)
	is Kit which provides the environment to DEVELOP AND EXECUTE(RUN) the Java program. JDK is a kit(or package) which includes two things
		1: Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs)
		2: JRE (to execute your java program).
			Note : JDK is only used by Java Developers.

Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
	 is an installation package which provides environment to *ONLY RUN (NOT DEVELOP)* the java program(or application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by them who only wants to run the Java Programs i.e. end users of your system.
	
Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
	is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both. Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for *EXECUTING THE JAVA PROGRAM LINE BY LINE* hence it is also known as interpreter.


JDK  (contains:) Development kit (what you need to write program)
	JRE (contains:) L
		JVM

JavaVirtualMachine is essentially creating the platform JUST ABOVE machine code (like a mini operating system almost) that can read BYTECODE by using files and information in the JavaRuntimeEnvironment

HelloWorld.Java
	Java Compiler (JAVAc in JDK)
		HelloWorld.class (HelloWorld.java compiled into ByteCode Executable class)
			Java Virtual Machine (can be ran on any system)

	Write Once Run Anywhere (WORA)

	JAVA BYTE CODE CAN RUN ANYWHERE THAT HAS JVM 
	THAT’S HOW JAVA IS A  WRITE ONCE AND RUN ANYWHERE LANGUAGE
