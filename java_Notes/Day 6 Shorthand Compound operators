Day 6


WAKE UP TASK:

Create a program to calculate the final discounted price of an item

Create three  variables called regularPrice, salePrice, and discount

Ask user for questions using scanner for regularPrice and discountPercentage and save the result into the variables

Calculate salePrice using above invormation

example: 80 regular price, 0.2 for discount

	Print out: regular price = 80 
				discount is 0.2
				your price is =


Shorthand operators or compound operators
	
	+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, ++, --

	these shorthand operators give you the same result as using a variable on both sides of the = 
		example:
			Original equation: variable = variable + 10;
			shorthand version: variable += 10;

			Original equation: variable = variable % 5;
			shorthand version: variable %= 5;

	Since increasing or decreasing a value is very special and often used in programing

			there is an even shorter shortcut for this operation

			we can use ++ or --, THIS IS EXCLUSIVELY FOR INCREASING OR DECREASING BY 1
				Example 
					Original equation: 			variable = variable + 1
					first shorthand option: 	variable += 1
					second shorthand option: 	++ variable
						all three options output the same value

					Original equation: 			variable = variable - 1
					first shorthand option: 	variable -= 1
					second shorthand option: 	-- variable
						all three options output the same value



		This shorthand helps declutter your code and makes your typing and code structure more efficient.
