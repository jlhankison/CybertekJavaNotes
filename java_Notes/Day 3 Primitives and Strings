Day 3: Primitives and Strings



print vs println

	Print:
		prints but does not move to the next line
	p

Escape sequence
	a character preceded by a backslash (\) is an escape sequence and has special meaning to the compiler

	It is used to place special characters and spaces in print and println commands
		\t places a tab within printed script
		\n place a return within printed script
		\' places a ' within printed text
		\" places a " within printed text
		\\ places a \ within printed text

Primitives:
	
	Integer Type:

		byte:
			memory used:
				1 byte
			range of values:
				-128 to 127
			example: 
				byte byteVar = 127;
				
		short
			memory used:
				2 bytes
			Range of values:
				-32768 to 32767
			Example:
				short shortVar = 128;
				
		int
			memory used:
				4 bytes
			range of values:
				-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
			Example:
				int intVar = 32768

		long
			must use L after number when declaring variable APPARENTLY
			
			memory used:
				8 bytes
			Range of values:
				-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
			Example:
				long longVar = 2,147,483,648L;

 	Floating Point types:

 		float
 			memory used:
 				4 bytes
 			example:
 				float priceOfTheBook = 49.99f ;
 		double
 			memory used:
 				8 bytes
 			range of values
 			Example
 				double meterTo

 	Single Character and boolean

 		Char:
 			Type
 				Single character
 			Memory used:
 				2 bytes
 			Range of values
 				all unicode values from 0 to 65535
 			Example:
 				char firstLetterOfName = "J" ;


 		Boolean
 			Memory used
 				1 bit
 			range of values:
 				True and false
 			Example:


 	String:
 		String is a sequence of characters, surrounded by double quotes("")
 		Example:
 			String greeting;
 			hello
