Day 15 LOOP INTRO!


LOOPS
	iteration
		looping allows you to repeat a function 


	WHILE LOOP

		psudo code
			while(A condition is TRUE){
				REPEAT THIS ACTION
			}

		CONDITION WILL KEEP REPEATING THIS ACTION FOREVER UNTIL CONDITON IS FALSE

		psudo code
			int x = 0 
			while(x<5){
				System.out.println("Happy New Year!")
				++x
			}

	DO WHILE LOOP

		will perform your function WHILE a condition is true
			the difference is:
				THE FUNCTION BEING PERFORMED WILL HAPPEN FIRST BEFORE THE CONDITION IS CHECKED

		do{
			//function goes here. function is performed BEFORE the while condition is checked
		}while(//condition goes here )

	FOR LOOP

		FOR anatomy;
			for (int x = 1 ; x < 5 ; x++){
				//code here
			}

			initialization
				int x = 1

				first step (is ignored after variable is initialized)

			termination conditon
				x < 5

				second step, checks the conditon for a FALSE

			function area
				//code here

				third step, performs the code within the loop

			increment
				x++

				modifies the value of the variable in the termination condition

		Loop Control commands

			break
				can be used in any type of loop

				if a line that contains break reaches the loop, it will stop!


			continue
				can be used in any type of loop

				if a line contains continue it will SKIP TO the next iteration
