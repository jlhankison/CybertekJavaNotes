ENCAPSULATION

	Encapsulation changes the status of an INSTANCE VARIABLE

		String example; <-- is a public variable that could be changed from the outside (xObject.example = "bla bla")

		private String example; <-- is a private variable that can be changed from the outside (xObject.example does not exist!)

	ANATOMY:

		Private:

			Private encapsulators designate that the Instance variable can only be modified within the class. 

				Constructors are needed to change the value of private variables
